# Introduction

As part of the INTOXICOM Implementation Study for the ELIXIR Toxicology Community a series of workshops is organized. The first INTOXICOM workshop was held in May 2024
[@citesAsRecommendedReading:citesAsEvidence:Martens2024INTOXICOM]. Here,
we here report on the 2nd workshop, titled "Enhancing Research Output: FAIR documentation and Tool Management for toxicology studies"
which was held from 27 to 28 November 2024 at the Main Building
of the University of Basel in Switzerland.

A team of ELIXIR Toxicology Community participants, including Marvin Martens, Danyel Jennen, Meike Bünger, Rob Stierum, Thomas Exner, Egon Willighagen, coordinated the event. Four experts were invited to
join the event: Sara Morsy (Training Platform, UK), Christian Bonatto Minella (FIZ Karlsruhe, DE), Kryštof Komanec (DS-Wizard, CZ), and Vassilios Ioannidis (FAIR Cookbook).

# The workshop

This workshop was a face-to-face, free-of-charge hands-on workshop
with the target audience being toxicologists with interest in using FAIR
data resources for their research or making their data FAIR, as well as data managers and
researchers working with Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs). It had 17 participants, 
12 in-person and 5 online. The participants represented a diverse set of organisations,
including universities (University of Bradford, University of Birmingham, Masaryk University,
University of Liege, University of Tartu, University of Plovdiv, Czech Technical University,
and Maastricht University), as well as research institutes (TNO, SIB, RIVM, FIX Karlsruhe)
and companies (Seven Past Nine GmbH). Additionally, representatives from regulatory bodies,
projects, and various ELIXIR Platforms participated.
Geographically, the workshop had attendees from The Netherlands, the UK, Germany, Czechia,
Belgium, Estonia, Bulgaria, and Switzerland.

## Presentations

The workshop again started with presentations to introduce ELIXIR, the ELIXIR Toxicology Community, the scope of the workshop, and the specific workshop sessions. Table 1 gives an overview of the presentations.

# Results

Section on FIPs... refer to INTOXICOM WS1 and new one at https://hackmd.io/@lusinke/rkXlvLXE0

Next session was about using BioSchemas to make training material more FAIR...
* Various resources... copy from common notes: e.g. https://nanocommons.github.io/user-handbook/ https://enanomapper.github.io/tutorials/BrowseOntology/Tutorial%20browsing%20eNM%20ontology.html https://zenodo.org/records/6769695
* Registration in ELIXIR TeSS
* toxicology curicula (like NL PET)

Second day, session on FAIR models ...

Next session on the DS-Wizard and the need for templates: https://ds-wizard.org/document-templates https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinja  What needs to be done by the Tox community is to create a knowledge model for the different 4 scientific models, QSAR, AOPs Wiki-pathways, ..
Action: organize a longer session. 

FAIRsharing and the ELIXIR Toxicology Community
